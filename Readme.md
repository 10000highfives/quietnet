# Quietnet

Simple chat program using near ultrasonic frequencies.

Worked when tested on a pair of Macbook Pros in close proximity in a room with ambient talking and worked!

If you can clearly hear the send transmitting then your speakers are probably not high quality enough to use at near ultrasonic range.
