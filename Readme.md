# Quietnet

Simple chat program using near ultrasonic frequencies.

Worked when tested on a pair of Macbook Pros in close proximity in a room with ambient talking and worked!

If you can clearly hear the send transmitting then your speakers are probably not high quality enough to use at near ultrasonic range.

## Usage

run `python send.py` in one terminal window and `python listen.py` in another. Text you input into the send.py window should appear (after a delay) in the listen.py window.
